# Library-Management-System
This Library Management System is a Python-based project designed to automate and streamline the management of library resources. This system replaces the traditional manual system with an efficient and user-friendly software solution that utilizes Python and MySQL for backend operations.
Features
Admin Login System: Secure login for administrators with password authentication.
Book Management:
Add new books with relevant details (title, author, publication, and number of copies).

mysql.connector: For connecting Python with MySQL.
tabulate: For formatted data presentation.
datetime: For managing dates related to lending and returns.
Platform: Windows 10
Key Highlights
Designed with user-defined functions, loops, and conditional statements for modular and maintainable code.
Fully interactive and time-efficient system for library management.
Helps minimize errors and provides easy access to book records and transaction details.
Setup Instructions
Install Python 3.10.7 and MySQL 8.0.
Import the SQL schema into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.
Run the Python script in an IDE or terminal after configuring the MySQL connection.
Use the admin credentials to log in and manage the library.
